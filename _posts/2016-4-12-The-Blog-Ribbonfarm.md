1. I came across learning about this interesting blog called Ribbonfarm <http://www.ribbonfarm.com/>, started by Venkatesh Rao. The blog pursues unusal takes in familiar themes. If you get fascinated learning about how the systems work, this is the right place for you. Let me inform you with the words of Venkatesh Rao: 


> Welcome to Ribbonfarm. This blog is devoted to refactored perception. That’s not exactly a helpful phrase, but think of it as an ongoing exploration of new perspectives for familiar things. The easiest way to get oriented is to dive right in.

> Here is a quick introduction to The Rust Age of Ribbonfarm (2007-2012), a relatively self-contained body of exploration,  mostly by Venkat. Includes curated collections of posts and even a map.
We are currently in the as-yet-unnamed second age of Ribbonfarm (2013 – ), a much more democratic age with a changing roster of residents. If you are uninterested in ancient history, you can safely join the party with the 2013 archives.
If you want some reading inspiration, check out the Now Reading page, where I track my own book reading.
